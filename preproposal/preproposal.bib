	abstract = {Mental workload (MW)-based adaptive system has been found to be an effective approach to enhance the performance of human-machine interaction and to avoid human error caused by overload. However, MW estimated from the spontaneously generated electroencephalogram (EEG) was found to be task-specific. In existing studies, EEG-based MW classifier can work well under the task used to train the classifier (within-task) but crash completely when used to classify MW of a task that is similar to but not included in the training data (cross-task). The possible causes have been considered to be the task-specific EEG patterns, the mismatched workload across tasks and the temporal effects. In this study, cross-task performance-based feature selection (FS) and regression model were tried to cope with these challenges, in order to make EEG-based MW estimator trained on working memory tasks work well under a complex simulated multi-attribute task (MAT). The results show that the performance of regression model trained on working memory task and tested on multi-attribute task with the feature subset picked-out were significantly improved (correlation coefficient (COR): 0.740 ± 0.147 and 0.598 ± 0.161 for FS data and validation data respectively) when compared to the performance in the same condition with all features (chance level). It can be inferred that there do exist some MW-related EEG features can be picked out and there are something in common between MW of a relatively simple task and a complex task. This study provides a promising approach to measure MW across tasks.},

In this paper we introduce across-subjectworkload classifier based on a hierarchical Bayes model. The cross-subject classifier is trained and tested with data from a group of subjects. In our work, it was trained and tested on EEG data collected from 8 subjects as they performed theMulti-Attribute Task Batteryacross three levels of difficulty. The accuracy of this cross-subject classifier is stable across the three levels of workload and comparable to a benchmark subject-specific neural network classifier.},

	abstract = {Mission success in military operations depends upon optimal functioning of all system components, including the human operator. The cognitive demands of current systems can exceed the capabilities of the human operator. In some situations, such as Unmanned Combat Air Vehicle (UCAV) operations, one operator may be required to supervise several vehicles simultaneously. The functional state of the human operator is not currently considered in the overall system assessment. It has been assumed that the operator could "manage" any situation given a well designed system. However, with the requirement to monitor and remotely monitor several vehicles simultaneously during combat comes the possibility of cognitive overload. This increases the probability of committing errors. We have developed on-line measures of operator functional state using psychophysiological measures. These measures provide estimates of how well an operator can deal with the current task demands. When the operator is cognitively overloaded the system may be able to implement adaptive aiding procedures. This will reduce the task demands on the operator thereby improving mission success. We have demonstrated correct assessment of the functional state of the operator with accuracies of 95\% or better. Psychophysiological measures were used with classifiers such as artificial neural networks. In one study, adaptive aiding was applied when the classifier determined operator overload. The aiding resulted in significantly improved performance.},

	abstract = {This paper proposed two psychophysiological-data-driven classification frameworks for operator functional states (OFS) assessment in safety-critical human-machine systems with stable generalization ability. The recursive feature elimination (RFE) and least square support vector machine (LSSVM) are combined and used for binary and multiclass feature selection. Besides typical binary LSSVM classifiers for two-class OFS assessment, two multiclass classifiers based on multiclass LSSVM-RFE and decision directed acyclic graph (DDAG) scheme are developed, one used for recognizing the high mental workload and fatigued state while the other for differentiating overloaded and base-line states from the normal states. Feature selection results have revealed that different dimensions of OFS can be characterized by specific set of psychophysiological features. Performance comparison studies show that reasonable high and stable classification accuracy of both classification frameworks can be achieved if the RFE procedure is properly implemented and utilized.},

	Abstract = {Adaptive automation is an approach to automation design where tasks are dynamically allocated between the human operator and computer systems. Psychophysiology has two complementary roles in research on adaptive automation: first, to provide information about the effects of different forms of automation thus promoting the development of effective adaptive logic; and second, psychophysiology may yield information about the operator that can be integrated with performance measurement and operator modelling to aid in the regulation of automation. This review discusses the basic tenets of adaptive automation and the role of psychophysiological measures in the study of adaptive automation. Empirical results from studies of flight simulation are presented. Psychophysiological measures may prove especially useful in the prevention of performance deterioration in underload conditions that may accompany automation. Individual differences and the potential for learned responses require research to understand their influence on adaptive algorithms. Adaptive automation represents a unique domain for the application of psychophysiology in the work environment.},

@article{Yin,
	Abstract = {This paper proposed two psychophysiological-data-driven classification frameworks for operator functional states (OFS) assessment in safety-critical human-machine systems with stable generalization ability. The recursive feature elimination (RFE) and least square support vector machine (LSSVM) are combined and used for binary and multiclass feature selection. Besides typical binary LSSVM classifiers for two-class OFS assessment, two multiclass classifiers based on multiclass LSSVM-RFE and decision directed acyclic graph (DDAG) scheme are developed, one used for recognizing the high mental workload and fatigued state while the other for differentiating overloaded and base-line states from the normal states. Feature selection results have revealed that different dimensions of OFS can be characterized by specific set of psychophysiological features. Performance comparison studies show that reasonable high and stable classification accuracy of both classification frameworks can be achieved if the RFE procedure is properly implemented and utilized.},

@article{Yang,
	Abstract = {Under the framework of adaptive Human--Machine (HM) systems, it has been proposed that human operators' task level should be dynamically adjusted according to his/her functional state. The construction of models that can reliably predict the operator functional state (OFS) becomes critical to accomplish such adjustments. However, most of the existing models that evaluate the current OFS by using operators' current physiological data are static and are of no real predictive capability. Thus, when they are used in adaptive HM systems, the resultant task allocation between operators and machines would be time-delayed. To overcome this problem, a one-step-ahead predictive model concept for OFS computation is proposed. Meanwhile, multiple fuzzy models are developed by using the Wang--Mendel method. These models are able to increase the accuracy of the OFS breakdown prediction, as well as to reduce the model training time. In addition, an adaptive task allocation strategy is designed to validate the proposed models. The results demonstrate that, compared to the conventional HM systems, a 6.7\% OFS increment and a 57.1\% OFS breakdown decrement can be obtained in the multiple models based adaptive HM systems. The multiple predictive models and the adaptive task allocation strategy would pave the way for future implementations of real-time adaptive HM systems.},

@article{Christensen,
	Abstract = {The application of pattern classification techniques to physiological data has undergone rapid expansion. Tasks as varied as the diagnosis of disease from magnetic resonance images, brain-computer interfaces for the disabled, and the decoding of brain functioning based on electrical activity have been accomplished quite successfully with pattern classification. These classifiers have been further applied in complex cognitive tasks to improve performance, in one example as an input to adaptive automation. In order to produce generalizable results and facilitate the development of practical systems, these techniques should be stable across repeated sessions. This paper describes the application of three popular pattern classification techniques to EEG data obtained from asymptotically trained subjects performing a complex multitask across five days in one month. All three classifiers performed well above chance levels. The performance of all three was significantly negatively impacted by classifying across days; however two modifications are presented that substantially reduce misclassifications. The results demonstrate that with proper methods, pattern classification is stable enough across days and weeks to be a valid, useful approach.},

@inproceedings{wilson_operator_2005,
	Abstract = {Mission success in military operations depends upon optimal functioning of all system components, including the human operator. The cognitive demands of current systems can exceed the capabilities of the human operator. In some situations, such as Unmanned Combat Air Vehicle (UCAV) operations, one operator may be required to supervise several vehicles simultaneously. The functional state of the human operator is not currently considered in the overall system assessment. It has been assumed that the operator could "manage" any situation given a well designed system. However, with the requirement to monitor and remotely monitor several vehicles simultaneously during combat comes the possibility of cognitive overload. This increases the probability of committing errors. We have developed on-line measures of operator functional state using psychophysiological measures. These measures provide estimates of how well an operator can deal with the current task demands. When the operator is cognitively overloaded the system may be able to implement adaptive aiding procedures. This will reduce the task demands on the operator thereby improving mission success. We have demonstrated correct assessment of the functional state of the operator with accuracies of 95\% or better. Psychophysiological measures were used with classifiers such as artificial neural networks. In one study, adaptive aiding was applied when the classifier determined operator overload. The aiding resulted in significantly improved performance.},

@article{Estepp_2015,
	Abstract = {The passive brain-computer interface (pBCI) framework has been shown to be a very promising construct for assessing cognitive and affective state in both individuals and teams. There is a growing body of work that focuses on solving the challenges of transitioning pBCI systems from the research laboratory environment to practical, everyday use. An interesting issue is what impact methodological variability may have on the ability to reliably identify (neuro)physiological patterns that are useful for state assessment. This work aimed at quantifying the effects of methodological variability in a pBCI design for detecting changes in cognitive workload. Specific focus was directed toward the effects of replacing electrodes over dual sessions (thus inducing changes in placement, electromechanical properties, and/or impedance between the electrode and skin surface) on the accuracy of several machine learning approaches in a binary classification problem. In investigating these methodological variables, it was determined that the removal and replacement of the electrode suite between sessions does not impact the accuracy of a number of learning approaches when trained on one session and tested on a second. This finding was confirmed by comparing to a control group for which the electrode suite was not replaced between sessions. This result suggests that sensors (both neurological and peripheral) may be removed and replaced over the course of many interactions with a pBCI system without affecting its performance. Future work on multi-session and multi-day pBCI system use should seek to replicate this (lack of) effect between sessions in other tasks, temporal time courses, and data analytic approaches while also focusing on non-stationarity and variable classification performance due to intrinsic factors.},

@article{Wang_R,
	Abstract = {With the development of human--machine systems, there has been a growing concern about the consequences of operator performance breakdown under excessive level of workload, especially in safety-critical situations. Assessment and detection of the operator functional state (OFS) enable us to predict the high operational risks of operator. This paper adopts the psychophysiological signals and task performance measures to evaluate OFS under different levels of mental workload. Four indices extracted from electrocardiogram and electroencephalogram, including heart rate (HR), ratio of the standard deviation to the average of HR segment, task load indices (TLI1 and TLI2), are chosen as the inputs of the proposed model. A technique of differential evolution with ant colony search (DEACS) is developed to optimize the parameters of Adaptive-Network-based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS). The optimized ANFIS model is employed to estimate the OFS under a series of process control tasks on a simulated software platform of AUTOmation-enhanced Cabin Air Management System. The results showed that the proposed adaptive fuzzy model based on ANFIS and DEACS algorithm is applicable for the operator functional state assessment.},

	Abstract = {This paper proposes a new framework for the online monitoring and adaptive control of automation in complex and safety-critical human-machine systems using psychophysiological markers relating to humans under mental stress. The starting point of this framework relates to the assessment of the so-called operator functional state using psychophysiological measures. An adaptive fuzzy model linking heart-rate variability and task load index with the subjects' optimal performance has been elicited and validated offline via a series of experiments involving process control tasks simulated on an automation-enhanced Cabin Air Management System. The elicited model has been used as the basis for an online control system via the predictions of the system performance indicators corresponding to the operator stressful state. These indicators have been used by a fuzzy decision maker to modify the level of automation under which the system may operate. A real-time architecture has been developed as a platform for this approach. It has been validated in a series of human volunteer studies with promising improvement in performance.},

@article{Wilson_2002,
	Abstract = {Piloting an aircraft is a complex task that places demands on several aspects of a pilot's cognitive capabilities. Because of the multifaceted nature of flying, several measures are required to identify the effects of these demands on the pilot. Several psychophysiological measures were recorded so that a wider understanding of the effects of these demands could be achieved. Heart rate, heart rate variability, eye blinks, electrodermal activity, topographically recorded electrical brain activity, and subjective estimates of mental workload were recorded. Ten pilots flew an approximately 90-min scenario containing both visual and instrument flight conditions. To determine the reliability of the psychophysiological measures, the pilots flew the same scenario twice. The responses during the 2 flights were essentially identical. Cardiac and electrodermal measures were highly correlated and exhibited changes in response to the various demands of the flights. Heart rate variability was less sensitive than heart rate. Alpha and delta bands of the brain activity showed significant changes to the varying demands of the scenarios. Blink rates decreased during the more highly visually demanding segments of the flights.},

@article{Zhang,
	Abstract = {The human operator's ability to perform their tasks can fluctuate over time. Because the cognitive demands of the task can also vary it is possible that the capabilities of the operator are not sufficient to satisfy the job demands. This can lead to serious errors when the operator is overwhelmed by the task demands. Psychophysiological measures, such as heart rate and brain activity, can be used to monitor operator cognitive workload. In this paper, the most influential psychophysiological measures are extracted to characterize Operator Functional State (OFS) in automated tasks under a complex form of human--automation interaction. The fuzzy c-mean (FCM) algorithm is used and tested for its OFS classification performance. The results obtained have shown the feasibility and effectiveness of the FCM algorithm as well as the utility of the selected input features for OFS classification. Besides being able to cope with nonlinearity and fuzzy uncertainty in the psychophysiological data it can provide information about the relative importance of the input features as well as the confidence estimate of the classification results. The OFS pattern classification method developed can be incorporated into an adaptive aiding system in order to enhance the overall performance of a large class of safety--critical human--machine cooperative systems.},

	Abstract = {Mental workload (MW)-based adaptive system has been found to be an effective approach to enhance the performance of human-machine interaction and to avoid human error caused by overload. However, MW estimated from the spontaneously generated electroencephalogram (EEG) was found to be task-specific. In existing studies, EEG-based MW classifier can work well under the task used to train the classifier (within-task) but crash completely when used to classify MW of a task that is similar to but not included in the training data (cross-task). The possible causes have been considered to be the task-specific EEG patterns, the mismatched workload across tasks and the temporal effects. In this study, cross-task performance-based feature selection (FS) and regression model were tried to cope with these challenges, in order to make EEG-based MW estimator trained on working memory tasks work well under a complex simulated multi-attribute task (MAT). The results show that the performance of regression model trained on working memory task and tested on multi-attribute task with the feature subset picked-out were significantly improved (correlation coefficient (COR): 0.740 $\pm$ 0.147 and 0.598 $\pm$ 0.161 for FS data and validation data respectively) when compared to the performance in the same condition with all features (chance level). It can be inferred that there do exist some MW-related EEG features can be picked out and there are something in common between MW of a relatively simple task and a complex task. This study provides a promising approach to measure MW across tasks.},
